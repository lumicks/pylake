    A method based on connecting feature points. Detection of the feature points is done analogously
    to [1], using a greyscale dilation approach to detect peaks, followed by a local centroid
    computation to achieve subpixel accuracy. After peak detection the feature points are linked
    together using a greedy forward search analogous to [2]. This in contrast with the linking
    algorithm in [1] which uses a graph based optimization approach.

    The linking step traverses the kymograph, tracing lines starting from each frame. It starts with
    the highest line and proceeds to lines with lower signal intensity. For every point along the
    line, the algorithm makes a prediction for where the particle will be in the next frame. Points
    are considered candidates for line membership when they fall within a cone parameterized by a
    sigma and diffusion constant. The candidate point closest to the prediction is chosen and
    connected to the line. When no more candidates are available the line is terminated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kymograph : lumicks.pylake.Kymo
        Kymograph.
    channel : str
        Kymograph channel.
    line_width : float
        Expected line width in physical units.
    pixel_threshold : float
        Intensity threshold for the pixels. Local maxima above this intensity level will be
        designated as a line origin.
    window : int
        Number of kymograph lines in which the particle is allowed to disappear (and still be part
        of the same line).
    sigma : float or None
        Uncertainty in the particle position. This parameter will determine whether a peak in the
        next frame will be linked to this one. Increasing this value will make the algorithm tend
        to allow more positional variation in the lines. If none, the algorithm will use half the
        line width.
    vel : float
        Expected velocity of the traces in the image in physical units. This can be used for
        non-static particles that are expected to move at an expected rate (default: 0.0).
    diffusion : float
        Expected diffusion constant in physical units (default: 0.0). This parameter will influence
        whether a peak in the next frame will be connected to this one. Increasing this value will
        make the algorithm allow more positional variation over time. If a particle disappears for
        a few frames and then reappears, points before and after the interval where the particle
        was not visible are more likely to be connected with a higher diffusion setting.
    sigma_cutoff : float
        Sets at how many standard deviations from the expected trajectory a particle no longer
        belongs to this trace. Lower values result in traces being more stringent in terms of
        continuing (default: 2.0).
    rect : tuple of two coordinates
        Only perform tracking over a subset of the image. When this argument is supplied, the peak
        detection and refinement is performed over the full image, but the results are then filtered
        to omit the peaks that fall outside of the rect. Coordinates should be given as:
        ((min_time, min_coord), (max_time, max_coord)).

    This function tracks particles in an image. It takes a pixel image, and traces lines on it.
    These lines can subsequently be refined and/or used to extract intensities or other parameters.

    This method is based on sections 1, 2 and 3 from [1]. This method attempts to find lines purely
    based on differential geometric considerations. It blurs the image based with a user specified
    line width and then attempts to find curvilinear sections. Based on eigenvalue decomposition of
    the local Hessian it finds the principal direction of the line. It then computes subpixel
    accurate positions by computing the maximum perpendicular to the line using local Taylor
    expansions. Pixels where this subpixel position estimate falls within the pixel are considered
    lines. The initial step leads to lines with a width of one. These lines are then traced. When
    ambiguity arises, on which point to connect next, a score comprised of the distance to the next
    subpixel minimum and angle between the successive normal vectors is computed. The candidate
    with the lowest score is then selected.

    For more information, please refer to the paper.
