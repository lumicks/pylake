    """Track particles on an image using a greedy algorithm.

    A method based on connecting feature points. Detection of the feature points is done analogously
    to [1]_, using a greyscale dilation approach to detect peaks, followed by a local centroid
    computation to achieve subpixel accuracy. After peak detection the feature points are linked
    together using a greedy forward search analogous to [2]_. This in contrast with the linking
    algorithm in [1]_ which uses a graph based optimization approach.

    The linking step traverses the kymograph, tracing tracks starting from each frame. It starts with
    the highest intensity track and proceeds to tracks with lower signal intensity. For every point along the
    track, the algorithm makes a prediction for where the particle will be in the next frame. Points
    are considered candidates for track membership when they fall within a cone parameterized by a
    sigma and diffusion constant. The candidate point closest to the prediction is chosen and
    connected to the track. When no more candidates are available the track is terminated.

    .. note::

        The `track_width` parameter is given in physical units, but the algorithm works with
        discrete pixels. In order to avoid bias in the result, the number of pixels to use is
        rounded up to the nearest odd value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kymograph : Kymo
        The kymograph to track.
    channel : {'red', 'green', 'blue'}
        Color channel to track.
    track_width : float or None
        Expected (spatial) spot size in physical units. Must be larger than zero.
        If `None`, the default is 0.35 (half the wavelength of the red limit of the visible spectrum)
        for kymographs calibrated in microns. For kymographs calibrated in kilobase pairs the
        corresponding value is calculated using 0.34 nm/bp (from duplex DNA).

        Note: For tracking purposes, the track width is rounded up to the nearest odd number of
        pixels; the resulting value must be at least 3 pixels.
    pixel_threshold : float or None
        Intensity threshold for the pixels. Local maxima above this intensity level will be
        designated as a track origin. Must be larger than zero. If `None`, the default is set to the
        98th percentile of the image signal.
    window : int
        Number of kymograph lines in which the particle is allowed to disappear (and still be part
        of the same track).
    sigma : float or None
        Uncertainty in the particle position. This parameter will determine whether a peak in the
        next frame will be linked to this one. Increasing this value will make the algorithm tend
        to allow more positional variation in the tracks. If none, the algorithm will use half the
        track width.
    velocity : float
        Expected velocity of the traces in the image in physical units. This can be used for
        non-static particles that are expected to move at a constant rate (default: 0.0).
    diffusion : float
        Expected diffusion constant in physical units (default: 0.0). This parameter will influence
        whether a peak in the next frame will be connected to this one. Increasing this value will
        make the algorithm allow more positional variation over time. If a particle disappears for
        a few frames and then reappears, points before and after the interval where the particle
        was not visible are more likely to be connected with a higher diffusion setting. Must be
        equal to or greater than zero.
    sigma_cutoff : float
        Sets at how many standard deviations from the expected trajectory a particle no longer
        belongs to this track. Lower values result in tracks being more stringent in terms of
        continuing (default: 2.0).
    rect : tuple of two coordinates
        Only perform tracking over a subset of the image. When this argument is supplied, the peak
        detection and refinement is performed over the full image, but the results are then filtered
        to omit the peaks that fall outside of the rect. Coordinates should be given as:
        ((min_time, min_coord), (max_time, max_coord)).
    bias_correction : bool
        Correct coordinate bias by ensuring that the window is symmetric (see [3]_ for more
        information). Note that while this increases the variance (reduces precision), it can
        greatly reduce the bias when there is a high background.

    This function tracks particles in an image. It takes a pixel image, and traces lines on it.

    Refinement is performed using a bias-corrected centroid optimization according to [2]_.

    This method is based on sections 1, 2 and 3 from [1]_. This method attempts to find lines purely
    based on differential geometric considerations. It blurs the image based with a user specified
    line width and then attempts to find curvilinear sections. Based on eigenvalue decomposition of
    the local Hessian it finds the principal direction of the line. It then computes subpixel
    accurate positions by computing the maximum perpendicular to the line using local Taylor
    expansions. Pixels where this subpixel position estimate falls within the pixel are considered
    lines. The initial step leads to lines with a width of one. These lines are then traced. When
    ambiguity arises, on which point to connect next, a score comprised of the distance to the next
    subpixel minimum and angle between the successive normal vectors is computed. The candidate
    with the lowest score is then selected.
