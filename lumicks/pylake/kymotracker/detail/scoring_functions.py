def kymo_diff_score(t, coordinate, t_prediction, vel, sigma, sigma_diffusion):
    """Estimate mean and sigma for future time points.

    This function returns a mean and sigma based on a velocity, fixed uncertainty and diffusion
    rate. This is used to compute a scoring function to determine whether two local maxima should
    be linked.

    We expect the future to be a combination of a base uncertainty, a diffusion and a constant
    velocity. The stdev for the particle at time point t for the diffusion process is given by:
        sigma(t) = N(mu(t), sigma*sqrt(t)).
    mu is simply given by the prediction based on constant velocity in this model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : float
        Current time
    coordinate : float
        Current position
    t_prediction : np.ndarray
        Coordinates for which to compute a probability
    vel : float
        Estimated velocity of the particle
    sigma: float
        Starting uncertainty of the cone.
    sigma_diffusion : float
        Sigma representing diffusion. For diffusion, the spread is characterized by:
          Sigma(t) = sigma_diffusion * sqrt(t)
        Note that sigma_diffusion equates to sqrt(2*D) where D is the diffusion constant.

    Returns
    -------
    mu_t : np.ndarray
        Mean of considered time points.
    sigma_t : np.ndarray
        Standard deviation of considered time points.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If predictive distributions are requested for points that aren't in the future.

def build_score_matrix(lines, times, coordinates, model, sigma_cutoff):
    """Build score matrix for a combination of lines and positions.

    The score matrix contains a score for each line, point pair. For each line, we calculate a penalty function which
    reflects a score associated with connecting those two lines. In the current implementation these are based on a
    Gaussian cone around the most likely trajectory. Sigma provides a starting width, whereas diffusion widens the cone
    over time.

    Since the score is simply used as a relative scoring metric, and we are not interested in the absolute values,
    we do not have to exponentiate the Gaussian.

    Above a certain cutoff value (sigma_cutoff), connections are considered very unlikely and candidates in those
    regions are considered to not be able to be part of the same line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lines: List[pylake.KymoLine]
    times: array_like
        Time points corresponding to the identified kymograph peaks.
    coordinates : array_like
        Positions of the identified kymograph peaks.
    model : callable
        Model which takes a particle's time and position and a list of prediction time points and then produces a mu
        and sigma for each of these future time points.
    sigma_cutoff: float
        At what fraction of sigma are points not going to be connected to this line at all?
