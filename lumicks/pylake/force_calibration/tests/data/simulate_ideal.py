    There's a term in the Langevin equation that can be used to take into account stage movement.
    Because the equations are linear, this term can be evaluated independently from the thermal
    part and added. See [1].

    The driving response is given by (Eq. 7 in [1]):

        x_response(t) = x_drive(t - t_lag) / sqrt(1 + (fc / fdrive)**2)

    With:

        fc = stiffness / (2.0 pi gamma)
        t_lag = (arctan(f_drive / fc) - pi/2) / (2 pi f_drive)

    """Simulate Brownian motion in optical trap

    This function simulates the Langevin equation that arises from a bead in an optical trap while
    the stage is oscillating. Rather than using a basic Euler scheme, we use the more exact
    simulation method from [1] which does not suffer from discretization error. Equation (72)
    from [1] reads:

        x[n+1] = c * x[n] + dx

    with:

        c = exp(-stiffness * dt / gamma)
        dx = sqrt( (1 - c^2) * diffusion * gamma / stiffness ) * normal(0, 1)

    For performance, we recast this simulation as a digital filter applied to a list of values drawn
    from a normal distribution rather than simulate it with a for loop.
