============

.. only:: html

Here's a sneak peek at the new features coming in Pylake `v1.3.0`:

Export correlated movies
------------------------

Movies exported with Pylake can now optionally show a correlated data slice by simply providing a :class:`~lumicks.pylake.channel.Slice` to the :meth:`~lumicks.pylake.scan.Scan.export_video` function.

Check out the exporting section in :ref:`ImageStack<stack_plotting>` and :ref:`Scan<confocal_plotting>` tutorial for more information.

More options for plotting images
--------------------------------

Now there's more flexibility with which color channels to plot for images, including shorthand
values for the red/green/blue channels and plotting only two colors:
