Pylake 1.3.0
============

.. only:: html

Pylake `v1.3.0` has been released with new features and improvements to existing analyses. Hereâ€™s some of the highlights:

Export correlated movies
------------------------

Movies exported with Pylake can now optionally show a correlated data slice by simply providing a :class:`~lumicks.pylake.channel.Slice` to the :meth:`~lumicks.pylake.scan.Scan.export_video` function.

.. figure:: export_correlated.gif

Check out the exporting section in :ref:`ImageStack<stack_plotting>` and :ref:`Scan<confocal_plotting>` tutorial for more information.

More options for plotting images
--------------------------------

Now there's more flexibility with which color channels to plot for images, including shorthand
values for the red/green/blue channels and plotting only two colors:

Check out :doc:`../../tutorial/plotting_images` for more information.

Filtering by duration
---------------------

You can now filter a :class:`~lumicks.pylake.kymotracker.kymotrack.KymoTrackGroup` by track duration (in seconds) rather than number of points.
You can do this by passing a `minimum_duration` to :meth:`~lumicks.pylake.filter_tracks`.
For more information see the :ref:`kymotracking tutorial<filter_tracks_tutorial>`.
