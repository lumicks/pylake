Pylake 1.2.0
============

Here's a sneak peak at some of the highlights from the upcoming Pylake `v1.2.0` release...

Generate colormaps according to emission wavelength
---------------------------------------------------

By default, single-channel images arising from fluorophores excited with the red, green, and blue lasers
are plotted with the corresponding `lk.colormaps.red`, `lk.colormaps.green`, and `lk.colormaps.blue`
colormaps, respectively. However, the actual light emitted is always red-shifted from the excitation color.
Now you can plot single-channel images with the approximate color of the signal emitted based on the
emission wavelength using the `from_wavelength()` method of :data:`~lumicks.pylake.colormaps`.

Cropping h5 files
-----------------

You can now use `File.save_as(crop_time_range=(start_timestamp, stop_timestamp))` to export a specific time range to a new `h5` file.
This can be useful for when you want to export a specific part of the timeline or a partial kymograph for instance.
Exporting a partial file helps keep file size down and makes it easier to share only the relevant parts of your data with others.
