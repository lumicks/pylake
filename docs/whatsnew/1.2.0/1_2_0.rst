Here's a sneak peak at some of the highlights from the upcoming Pylake `v1.2.0` release...

Generate colormaps according to emission wavelength
---------------------------------------------------

By default, single-channel images arising from fluorophores excited with the red, green, and blue lasers
are plotted with the corresponding `lk.colormaps.red`, `lk.colormaps.green`, and `lk.colormaps.blue`
colormaps, respectively. However, the actual light emitted is always red-shifted from the excitation color.
Now you can plot single-channel images with the approximate color of the signal emitted based on the
emission wavelength using the `from_wavelength()` method of :data:`~lumicks.pylake.colormaps`.
