Hidden Markov Models
--------------------

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are often used for analyzing data that shows transitions among discrete
states. Now with just a few lines of code you can fit any channel data and view the results.
If you're interested in kinetics, the model also generates data that can be used with
:class:`~lumicks.pylake.DwelltimeModel` to extract state lifetimes.

Check out the :ref:`hmm-section` tutorial and the
:class:`~lumicks.pylake.HiddenMarkovModel` API page for more information.
