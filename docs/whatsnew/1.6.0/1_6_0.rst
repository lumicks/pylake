Pylake 1.6.0
============

Here is a sneak preview of features that will likely be in Pylake `v1.6.0`.

Bead-bead coupling correction
-----------------------------

.. figure:: correction_factor_whatsnew.png

When performing active calibration with two beads coupling effects can bias the estimated calibration parameters (force and displacement sensitivity, and the stiffness).
In Pylake 1.6.0, we include a model to account for bead-bead coupling between two beads in bulk.
See :ref:`theory<bead_bead_theory>` and :ref:`tutorial<bead_bead_tutorial>` for more information.
