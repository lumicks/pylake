Pylake 1.5.0
============

.. only:: html

Pylake `v1.5.0` has been released with new features and improvements to existing analyses. Hereâ€™s some of the highlights:

Plotting with channel data
--------------------------

Added :meth:`Kymo.plot_with_channels()<lumicks.pylake.kymo.Kymo.plot_with_channels()>` to plot kymograph data along with data from multiple channels.

.. figure:: plot_with_channels.png

    A plot of a kymograph with force data and photon counts where we customized color, labels and down-sampling.

This function allows for fine grained plot customization.
See :ref:`correlated plotting<kymo_correlation>` for more information.

Improved customization of correlated plots
------------------------------------------

Added option to disable down-sampling channel data to frame rates when plotting or exporting correlated channel data with scans and images.
This option is now available in the plotting methods :meth:`ImageStack.plot_correlated()<lumicks.pylake.ImageStack.plot_correlated()>`, :meth:`Scan.plot_correlated()<lumicks.pylake.scan.Scan.plot_correlated()>` and video export methods :meth:`ImageStack.export_video()<lumicks.pylake.ImageStack.export_video()>` and :meth:`Scan.export_video()<lumicks.pylake.scan.Scan.export_video()>`.

.. figure:: less_downsampling.gif

    A correlated movie of a multi-frame scan with a customized level of down-sampling.

Improved returned statistics force calibration
----------------------------------------------

A bug in the calculation of the goodness of fit in force calibration routine was fixed.
For more information on this quantity, please see the section on :ref:`goodness of fit<goodness_of_fit>`.
Note that this bug did not affect force calibration results, only the value of this statistic.
In addition, the force calibration routine now returns standard errors on the stiffness and displacement sensitivity in the table of fit results.

Updated dependencies
--------------------

Starting from Pylake `1.5.0`, we have updated some of our dependencies.

If you installed Pylake with jupyter `notebook`, you may have to update uses of `%matplotlib notebook` with `%matplotlib widget` in existing notebooks.
See the :ref:`FAQ<notebook7>` for more information.

We also dropped support for Python `3.9` in favor of the newer `3.12`.

Other changes
-------------

In addition, this release contains several other bug-fixes and improvements.
For a full list of all the changes, please refer to the full :doc:`changelog</changelog>`.

Happy Pylake-ing!
