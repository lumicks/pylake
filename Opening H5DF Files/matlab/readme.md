# Matlab compatibility examples

Matlab can call Python libraries.
The `example.m` in this directory shows how to call `pylake` from Matlab.
The `timeslice.m` and `to_matlab.m` functions can slice data channels and convert the resulting arrays to Matlab.  
To use these functions as shown in `example.m`, `pylake` must be installed.
See the documentation for detailed installation instructions.
