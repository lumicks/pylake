# Changelog

## v0.6.0 | t.b.d.
* Add literature page to the documentation.
* Fix docstring for `Fit.plot()`.
* Verify starting timestamp when reconstructing Kymo or Scan.
* Optimized reconstruction algorithm for sum.
* Fixed bug related to reconstruction failing for images with flipped fast and slow axis.
* Plot and return images and timestamps for kymos using physical coordinate system rather than fast and slow scanning axis. Note that this is a potentially breaking change!

## v0.5.0 | 2020-06-08
* Added F, d Fitting functionality (beta, see docs tutorial section `Fd Fitting` and examples `Twistable Worm-Like-Chain Fitting` and `RecA Fd Fitting`).
* Fixed an issue which prevented images from being reconstructed when a debugger is attached. Problem resided in `reconstruct_image` which threw an exception when attempting to resize a `numpy` array while the debugger was holding a reference to it.
* Fixed bug that lead to timestamps becoming floating point values when using `channel.downsampled_over`.

## v0.4.1 | 2020-03-23
* Drop `matplotlib` < 3 requirement.
* Add functionality which redirects users to the API when accessing particular fields, e.g. accessing `file["FD curve"]` will throw an error and redirect users to use `file.fdcurves`.
* Add API for markers, i.e. `file.markers` returns a dictionary of markers (see docs tutorials section: Files and Channels).
* Bugfix `CorrelatedStack.plot()` which resulted in the function throwing an error rather than showing a single frame.
* Add canvas draw call to `CorrelatedStack.plot_correlated()` to make sure the plot is also interactive when it is not run from an interactive notebook.

## v0.4.0 | 2020-01-21

* Add calibration data as attribute of force channels (see docs tutorials section: Files and Channels).
* Fixed bug which produced shifted timestamps when slicing continuous channel with time values between two data points.
* Export pixel size and dwell time to exported TIFFs.
* Implement slicing for kymographs (see docs tutorials section: Kymographs).
* Show keys in a group when printing the group.
* Allow iteration over groups.
* Fix bug which could cause axes to be inverted for reconstructed images.
* Add functionality to correlate images recorded from cameras with timeline data (see docs tutorial section: Correlated stacks).

## v0.3.1 | 2019-03-27

* Loading scans and kymographs is now much faster
* Improved perfomance of slicing continuous channels
* Fixed `Unknown channel kind` error with the v2 file format
* Fixed deprecation warnings with h5py v2.9

## v0.3.0 | 2018-12-04

* TIFF scan exports now default to using 32bit floats
* Support for photon time tag data has been added (Bluelake version 1.5.0 and higher, HDF5 file format version 2)
* File properties like `File.kymos`, `File.scans` now return empty `dict` objects instead of an error if there are no such items in the file

## v0.2.0 | 2018-07-27

* Channel slices can be downsampled: `lf_force = hf_force.downsampled_by(factor=20)`
* `FDCurve`s now support subtraction, e.g. `fd = f.fdcurves["measured"] - f.fdcurves["baseline"]`
* Scans and kymos now have a `.timestamps` property with per-pixel timestamps with the same shape as the image arrays
* Added Matlab compatibility examples to the repository in `examples/matlab`
* `h5py` >= v2.8 is now required

## v0.1.0 | 2018-06-20

* Initial release
